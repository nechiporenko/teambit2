                        Teambit may, from time to time, make certain Paid Services available on a free trial basis for a limited period of time ("Free Trial"). Except as explicitly provided otherwise by Teambit in an authorized offer for a Free Trial, to be eligible for a Free Trial offered by Teambit in respect of a particular Paid Service, you must satisfy the following criteria: (a) you must not already be subscribed to receive the Paid Service on a paid basis (b) you must not already be participating in a Free Trial for the Paid Service or have previously participated in a Free Trial for the Paid Service; and (c) you must register a valid User Account. Upon the earlier of the expiration of the Free Trial for a Paid Service or your election to subscribe to the Paid Service on a paid basis, the Free Trial will automatically terminate and you will no longer be eligible to participate in any future Free Trials for the Paid Service. Teambit reserves the right to modify the terms of any Free Trial and the eligibility criteria required for participation in any Free Trial, at any time at is sole discretion.<br /><br />

                        (b) Paid Subscription<br /><br />

A Paid Service will not be activated until your Payment Information is validated and Teambit receives payment for the Paid Service. In addition, you agree to maintain current, valid and supported Payment Information with Teambit. You may update your billing and payment information through the "Account Billing Tab" available on the Sites. Currently, Teambit supported payment methods are MasterCard, Visa or American Express. Payments will be charged in U.S. dollars. Teambit reserves the right to modify its supported payment methods at any time at its sole discretion. Teambit will endeavor to provide you with at least 30 days notice of any change to supported payment methods that will require a change to your Payment Information in order to continue receiving a Paid Service.<br /><br />

                        (c) Payment<br /><br />

                        By registering for a Paid Service (other than as part of a Free Trial), you represent that you are authorized to use the Payment Information that you have provided to Teambit, and you authorize Teambit to charge the subscription fees ("Subscription Fee") and all Applicable Taxes (defined below) associated with the Paid Service using your Payment Information. Subscription Fees and Applicable Taxes are due, and will be charged using your Payment Information, in advance, at the time of purchase and on a recurring basis near the beginning of each payment period ("Payment Period") as selected or required with the Paid Service. Unless specifically specified otherwise, all subscriptions for Paid Services will automatically renew for successive Payment Periods upon the expiration of each Payment Period unless cancelled by you or terminated/discontinued by Teambit in accordance with these Terms.<br /><br />

                        Subscription Fees are exclusive of, and you shall be responsible for, all taxes, tariffs, duties and other charges or assessments imposed or levied by any government or governmental agency in connection with the Paid Services ("Applicable Taxes"), including, without limitation, any federal, provincial, state and local sales, use, goods and services, value-added and personal property taxes on any payments due to Teambit in connection with the Paid Services, except for tax based solely on the net income of Teambit. If Teambit is required to pay any Applicable Taxes in connection with any Paid Services that you have subscribed to, you authorize Teambit to charge those Applicable Taxes using your Payment Information.<br /><br />

                        (d) Modification of Paid Service/Subscription Fees by Teambit<br /><br />

                        Teambit reserves the right to modify the Paid Services and Subscription Fees from time to time at its sole discretion. Teambit will provide you with notice ("Change Notice") of any material modifications to a Paid Service or associated Subscription Fee for which you have subscribed by sending an email to the email address that you have registered under your User Account. If you do not cancel your Paid Services within 30 days from the date of the Change Notice, you will be deemed to have irrevocably accepted the modifications to the Paid Services and Subscription Fees identified in the Change Notice.<br /><br />

                        (e) Cancellation, Upgrade or Downgrade of Paid Service by You<br /><br />

                        Your subscription and obligation to pay for a subscribed Paid Service will continue indefinitely until cancelled by you or terminated/discontinued by Teambit. For some Paid Services, you may entitled to upgrade or downgrade the Paid Service to the extent and on the terms permitted by Teambit from time to time. By upgrading or downgrading a Paid Service, you authorize Teambit to charge any associated changes to the Subscription Fee in accordance with the payment terms for Subscription Fees and Applicable Taxes described above.<br /><br />

                        The cancellation, upgrade or downgrade of a Paid Service may be requested through the "Account Billing Tab", however, you acknowledge that such cancellation, upgrade or downgrade may not be effective for up to 5 business days after receipt of such request by Teambit. Accordingly, in order to avoid being charged the then-current Subscription Fee for a Paid Service for the next Payment Period, you must cancel, upgrade or downgrade the Paid Service at least 5 business days prior to the start of the next Payment Period. UPON CANCELLATION, UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF A PAID SERVICE BY YOU, OR UPON TERMINATION/DISCONTINUANCE OF A PAID SERVICE BY Teambit, YOU WILL NOT BE REFUNDED OR PROVIDED CREDIT FOR SUBSCRIPTION FEES OR APPLICABLE TAXES FOR ANY REMAINING PORTION OF THE CURRENT PAYMENT PERIOD OR FOR ANY CHANGE TO THE SUBSCRIPTIONS FEES OR APPLICABLE TAXES RESULTING FROM AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE PAID SERVICE.]<br /><br />

                        (f) Late Payments<br /><br />

                        If Teambit does not receive payment of the Subscription Fee and Applicable Taxes for a Paid Service when due, Teambit reserves the right to terminate or suspend your subscription to the Paid Service at its sole discretion.

                    <p class="page__date">Updated: November 29, 2015</p>
                    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
                    <p>
                        The most fundamental privacy principle we follow is that by default, anything you post to Teambit is private to your team.<br /><br />

                        Teambit is the custodian of data on behalf of the teams that use Teambit. We don’t own team data. Teams own their data. They like it that way and so do we.<br /><br />

                        Privacy goes hand in glove with security and confidentiality. They are all very important to us and we take them very seriously.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>

When we talk about Teambit in this policy, it’s applicable to Teambit, Inc., (the “Company") and Teambit websites available under the domain name “teambit.io" (the “Sites"). We will only collect, use and disclose your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br /><br />

                        This policy describes how Teambit treats your information, not how other organizations treat your information. If you are using Teambit in a workplace or on a device or account issued to you by your employer or another organization, that company or organization likely has its own policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, and retention of communications and content which may apply to your use of Teambit. Please check with your employer or team owner about the policies it has in place regarding your activity on Teambit.<br /><br />

                        By providing Personal Information to us, you agree and consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
